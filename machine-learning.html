            <h4>by Vadim Smolyakov </h4>
            <p>
                Machine Learning Algorithms in Depth dissects and explains dozens of algorithms across a variety of
                applications, including finance, computer vision, and NLP. Each algorithm is mathematically derived,
                followed by its hands-on Python implementation along with insightful code annotations and informative
                graphics. You’ll especially appreciate author Vadim Smolyakov’s clear interpretations of Bayesian
                algorithms for Monte Carlo and Markov models.

            <h3>Math for Machine Learning</h3>
            <h4>by Nicole Königstein</h4>
            <p>
                In this series of liveProjects, you’ll work with Finative, an analytics firm focused on environmental,
                social, and governance (ESG) metrics that gauge companies' sustainability. You’ll apply machine learning
                (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques—such as Bayes' theorem, PCA, cosine similarity, latent semantic
                analysis, and backpropagation—to enhance Finative’s sustainability efforts.

                Projects will include reducing ML model runtime, optimizing storage by identifying key document
                keywords, classifying sustainability reports using pre-trained language models, and analyzing tweet
                sentiment to detect greenwashing. By the end, you’ll gain a solid understanding of ML fundamentals, data
                science skills, and sustainability-focused analytics.
